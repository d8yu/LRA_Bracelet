<h1>BEAR LRA Bracelet</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
As part of the BEAR lab at UC Davis, I've designed a prototype for a bracelet that will be used in future experiments to enhance pediatric prosthetics embodiment and control by using vibratory stimulation of muscle to induce illusory movement.


In this repo, you will find the associated code and 3D print files.

<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>

To install and configure the bracelet, download all src files and place them in an accesible folder. 

Open the .ino src file into the Arduino IDE and upload to the board after configuring the hardware as described in the [hardware_configuration](configuration_instructions/hardware_configuration.txt) file and the software as described in the [software_configuration](configuration_instructions/software_configuration) file
