This document gives a brief summary and overview of the hardware for the BEAR bracelet. 

At the heart of the bracelet is an Arduino MCU. 

From this MCU, we can control our linear resonance actuators (LRAs) by using the library provided in the src

It is only possible to control a singular LRA from the Arduino due to the DRV2605L motor drivers having the same hardcoded i2c address. 

To overcome this issue, we must use an i2c multiplexer to allow the MCU to interact with multiple devices withe same i2c address. 


To connect the LRAs to the Arduino, wire the positive and negative leads (usually marked by red and black) to their respective leads on the DRV2605L motor driver board. 

Next, instead of connecting the SDA and SCL lines from the motor driver boards to the Arduino's SDA and SCL pins-connect the Arduino's pins to the SDA and SCL pins on the PCA9548A i2c multiplexer board. 

You can find the Arduino's i2c lines by consulting the respective board's datasheet.
